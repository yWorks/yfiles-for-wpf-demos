# Layout Only Demos
These samples show how to work with the graph structure and the analysis and layout algorithms in the algorithms package without using classes from the viewer part. These are either pure console applications that don't provide any visualization, or the resulting layouts are visualized with a simple viwer application. For more examples wich use the viewer code, please see the samples in [yFiles WPF Layout demos](../Layout) and [yFiles WPF Complete demos](../Complete). 

You will find the following programming samples in this package: 


| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
|**AdvancedLayout** | Shows how to use advanced layout features like port constraints and automatic labeling with only the algorithms package available. |
|**Graph** | This demo shows how to work with the Graph implementation of the algorithms package. |
|**GroupingLayout** | Demonstrates the use of node and edge grouping in combination with the layout algorithms that are capable of interpreting these sophisticated features if only the algorithms package is available. |
|**HierarchicLayout** | Demonstrates the use of the incremental layout facility provided by class HierarchicLayout if only the algorithms package is available. |
|**LayoutGraphViewer** | I rudimentary viewer component for Windows Forms that can render a layout graph. |
|**List** | This demo shows how to work with the list implementation of the algorithms package. |
|**NodeMap** | Demonstrates how to use node maps. The demo compares the performance of different mechanisms to bind extra data to the nodes of a graph in the algorithms package. |
|**ShortestPathAlgorithm** | Demonstrates how to find shortest paths in graphs using the algorithms package only. |
|**SimpleLayout** | Shows how to use important layout and routing algorithms to calculate coordinates for a graph with only the algorithm package being available. Featured layout and routing styles are Organic, Orthogonal (Router), Orthogonal (Layout), Circular, and Hierarchical. |
|**SwimLaneLayout** | Demonstrates the use of the swim lane layout capabilities of class HierarchicLayout if only the algorithms package is available. |

## Running the Demos

### With Visual Studio

* To load all samples into Visual Studio you can simply open the solution file yFiles Demos.sln. 
* To load a single sample into Visual Studio you can open the project file (.csproj) in the sample's directory.
