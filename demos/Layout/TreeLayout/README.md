# TreeLayout

This demo demonstrates the different `INodePlacer` implementations for the
     `TreeLayout` algorithm.
     An `INodePlacer` can be assigned to each node separately. It arranges the node it is
		assigned to and its sub trees. In this demo all nodes of the same layer have the same node placer.
