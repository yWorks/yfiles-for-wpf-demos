# Layout Demos
These source code samples demonstrate the basic usage of the yFiles WPF layout algorithms to assign coordinates to your graph elements. For more complex examples, please see the samples in [yFiles WPF Complete demos](../Complete). Examples which don't use the yFiles WPF viewer components are shown in the [yFiles WPF LayoutOnly demos](../LayoutOnly). 

You will find the following programming samples in this package: 


| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
|**AbortHandler** | Shows how to abort running layout algorithms. |
|**BusRouter** | This Demo shows how to use a BusRouter as layout. |
|**IncrementalHierarchicLayout** | Demonstrates the use of the incremental layout facility provided by class HierarchicLayout. |
|**InteractiveOrganic** | Sample Form that demonstrates the usage of InteractiveOrganicLayout. |
|**LayerConstraints** | Demonstrates how to use layer constraints with the HierarchicLayout to restrict the node layering. |
|**LayoutConfigurations** | A demo library which provides several configurations for layout algorithms to be used with the option handler as shown in the LayoutStyles demo. |
|**LayoutStyles** | This demo demonstrates the automatic layout algorithms shipped with yFiles and how the different settings affect the generated layout. <br />**Note: **This demo depends on the layout configurations from the `Demo.yFiles.Layout.Configurations` programming sample and on the option editor from the sample `Demo.yFiles.Toolkit.OptionHandler`. |
|**MarqueeClearArea** | A demo that shows how to interactively move graph elements within a marquee area. |
|**MazeRouting** | This demo shows how the automatic edge routing finds routes through a maze. |
|**MixedLayout** | This demo shows how to use the recursive group layout to apply different layouts to the contents of group nodes. |
|**MultiPage** | Shows how to use the multipage layout. |
|**NodeLabeling** | Shows how to use a node labeling algorithm with different label models. |
|**PartialLayout** | This demo shows how to apply `PartialLayout` to orthogonal, organic, hierarchic or circular layouts and the effect of some of its configuration settings. |
|**PortCandidate** | This demo shows how to use PortCandidateSets in conjunction with HierarchicLayout. |
|**PreferredLabelPlacement** | Shows how the PreferredPlacementDescriptor for edge labels affects the label placement of layout algorithms. |
|**SankeyLayout** | This demo demonstrates how HierarchicLayout can be used to create Sankey diagrams. |
|**SequenceConstraints** | Demonstrates how to use sequence constraints with the HierarchicLayout to restrict the node sequencing. |
|**TreeLayout** | This demo demonstrates the different `INodePlacer` implementations for the `TreeLayout` algorithm. |

## Running the Demos

### With Visual Studio

* To load all samples into Visual Studio you can simply open the solution file yFiles Demos.sln. 
* To load a single sample into Visual Studio you can open the project file (.csproj) in the sample's directory.
