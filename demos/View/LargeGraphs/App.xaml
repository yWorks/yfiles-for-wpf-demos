                        <Paragraph>This demo illustrates improvements in rendering performance for very large graphs
                            in yFiles WPF. The default settings are adequate for graphs up to a few hundred elements.
                            Scaling to several thousands of elements is possible with a bit of tweaking, though.</Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>The impact of each individual setting depends on the graph, its layout, and how you
                            interact with it. This demo comes with settings tailored to each example graph. Your use
                            cases might require different parameters or even other methods.</Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>Drawing the overview is costly since the number of visuals in the overview control
                            is the same as in the normal graph control. Therefore, before investigating other aspects
                            it is recommended to disable the overview.</Paragraph>

                            tree to the elements that are actually visible. This works well when only a hundred
                            visuals need to removed or added at a time, but results in significant stutter if
                            thousands of visuals are affected. The latter typically happens when panning or zooming a
                            large graph at a low zoom level.
                        </Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>To avoid this, virtualization should be disabled at very low zoom levels, but kept
                            enabled at medium to high zoom levels, as this will lower memory usage (and improve
                            performance when fewer elements are visible).</Paragraph>
                        <Paragraph>These values are very sensitive to the displayed graph and its layout as the values
                            depend mostly on how many items are visible at once. Turning off virtualization improves
                            panning performance noticeably, at the expense of making zooming across the threshold
                            slower. There is no special handling for labels here since those shouldn't be visible at
                            such low zoom levels.</Paragraph>


                        <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource HtmlH2}">Selection Performance</Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>Selections, especially drawing the selection decoration and the resize handles, can
                            be slow, especially when several thousand elements are selected. Basically this adds at
                            least as many elements to the visual tree as there are selected items, so a performance
                            drop can be expected. By disabling handles and using dedicated decoration renderers we can
                            keep the impact a bit lower.</Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource HtmlH2}">Label Model Baking</Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>As mentioned before, calculating label placement can be expensive. While hiding
                            labels at low zoom levels is a good way to cope with this, there are more drastic measures
                            that can be taken if the graph is known to not change. By replacing all label's models
                            with a suitable
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">FreeLabelModel</Run> parameter, the
                            amount of work to determine label placement can be minimized. The drawback is that labels
                            now no longer move with their nodes or edges.
                        </Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource HtmlH2}">Dirty Handling</Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>Another (very low-level) optimization can be done when the graph is known to be
                            unchanging. Every object in a
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">CanvasControl</Run> is placed in a tree of
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">CanvasObject</Run>s, each of which has a
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">CanvasObjectDescriptor</Run> that handles
                            hit-testing, visibility checks and creating/updating visuals. For the most part that
                            descriptor looks very similar to a style, and by default in fact delegates to an item's
                            style. A descriptor also has a
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlEm}">dirty</Run> flag that
                            is taken into account for visibility checks and updates while drawing.
                        </Paragraph>

                        <Paragraph>By writing a custom descriptor that mostly returns
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">false</Run> for
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">IsDirty</Run> we can side-step almost all
                            visibility checks and calls to
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlCode}">UpdateVisual</Run>.
                            This greatly increases rendering speed as almost nothing needs to be done anymore. The
                            caveat is that we have to manually update the
                            <Run Style="{StaticResource HtmlEm}">dirty</Run> flag when something changed. In this demo 
                            this is only done for the zoom level changes that are configured on the right, but more
                            complex solutions are possible.
