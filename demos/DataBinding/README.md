# Data Binding Demos
These source code samples demonstrate how to use the `TreeSource` and `GraphSource` classes for binding graph elements to business data in yFiles WPF. 

You will find the following programming samples in this package: 


| Name | Description 
|:---|:---
|**AdjacencyGraphBuilder** | Demonstrates data binding using class `AdjacencyGraphBuilder`. 
|**BusinessModelAdapter** | Shows how to integrate a custom Business Model with yFiles WPF. 
|**DataSet** | Sample Form that demonstrates data binding using a `TreeSource` to a DataSet. 
|**Dynamic** | Sample Form that demonstrates data binding using a `TreeSource` to dynamic business data. 
|**GraphBuilder** | Demonstrates data binding using class `GraphBuilder`. 
|**GraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `GraphSource`. 
|**InteractiveEdgesGraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `AdjacentEdgesGraphSource`. Allows interactive changes to the data model and dynamically updates the graph structure accordingly. 
|**InteractiveNodesGraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `AdjacentNodesGraphSource`. Allows interactive changes to the data model and dynamically updates the graph structure accordingly.
