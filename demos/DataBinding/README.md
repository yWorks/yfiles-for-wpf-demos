|**DataSet** | Sample Form that demonstrates data binding using a `TreeSource` to a DataSet. |
|**Dynamic** | Sample Form that demonstrates data binding using a `TreeSource` to dynamic business data. |
|**GraphBuilder** | Demonstrates data binding using class `GraphBuilder`. |
|**GraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `GraphSource`. |
|**InteractiveEdgesGraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `AdjacentEdgesGraphSource`. Allows interactive changes to the data model and dynamically updates the graph structure accordingly. |
|**InteractiveNodesGraphSource** | Demonstrates data binding using class `AdjacentNodesGraphSource`. Allows interactive changes to the data model and dynamically updates the graph structure accordingly. |
