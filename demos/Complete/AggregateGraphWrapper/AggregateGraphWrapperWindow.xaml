                        This demo shows how to analyze a graph by
                        <Run FontWeight="Bold">aggregating groups of nodes</Run>.
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph>
                        Via the context menu, groups of nodes of the same color or shape can be aggregated giving different insights about
                        the graph. For example, aggregating all nodes by <Run FontWeight="Bold">color</Run> shows
                        that there are no connections between purple and green nodes, while blue nodes are connected to both other colors.
                        Aggregating by <Run FontWeight="Bold">shape and color</Run> shows that there are no connections
                        between rectangle shaped nodes of different color and no connections between green nodes of
                        different shape.

                    <Paragraph>
                        The demo makes use of the <Run FontStyle="Italic">AggregateGraphWrapper</Run> class, that allows
                        for aggregating graph items by hiding items and adding new items to a wrapped graph.
