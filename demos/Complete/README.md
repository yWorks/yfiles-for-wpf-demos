# Complete Demos
These source code samples demonstrate the interaction between the viewer component and the layout algorithms in yFiles WPF. 

You will find the following programming samples in this package: 


| Name | Description |
|:---|:---|
|**AggregateGraphWrapper** | This demo shows how to use the AggregateGraphWrapper to turn a large graph into a small one by aggregating groups of nodes. |
|**BasicLayout** | Shows how to use important layout and routing algorithms to calculate coordinates for a graph. |
|**Collapse** | A form that demonstrates the wrapping and decorating of `IGraph` instances. <br /> This demo shows a collapsible tree structure. Subtrees can be collapsed or expanded by clicking on their root nodes. |
|**ComponentDragAndDrop** | A demo that shows how to make space for components by dragging them from a DnD palette onto the canvas. |
|**FillAreaAfterDeletion** | A demo that shows how to fill free space after deleting nodes. |
|**GraphAnalysis** | Demonstrates the most important graph analysis algorithms from the Layout and Analysis part of yFiles WPF. |
|**HierarchicGrouping** | A demo that demonstrates how to automatically trigger an incremental layout when opening or closing groups. |
|**InteractiveClearArea** | A demo that shows how to interactively move graph elements within a rectangular area in a given graph layout so that the modifications in the graph are minimal. |
|**IsometricDrawing** | Sample application that displays graphs in an isometric fashion to create an impression of a 3-dimensional view. |
|**LargeGraphAggregation** | This demo shows how to use the smart NodeAggregation algorithm for drill down exploration of a large graph. |
|**LogicGate** | This demo shows how ports can be used to implement a digital system comprising logic gates and similar components. |
|**Neo4JIntegration** | This demo shows how to load data from a Neo4j database and display it with yFiles WPF. |
|**NetworkMonitoring** | This demo shows a basic network monitoring tool. You can watch the traffic flowing through the network and even influence the network by deactivating nodes. |
|**NodeTypes** | A demo that shows how different layout algorithms handle nodes with types. |
|**OrgChart** | An organization chart demo. |
|**OverlapAvoidingEditor** | A demo that shows how to interactively edit graphs without creating overlaps. |
|**RelocateSubtree** | A demo that shows how to interactively relocate subtrees from one parent to another. |
|**RotatableNodes** | Shows how support for rotated node visualizations can be implemented on top of the yFiles library. <br /> A custom yWorks.Graph.Styles.INodeStyle implementation is used to encapsulate most of the added functionality. |
|**ShortestPath** | Shows how to use shortest path algorithms from the Layout and Analysis part of yFiles WPF. |
|**TableEditor** | This demo shows how to use and manipulate `ITable` instances. <br /> We show how table nodes can be interactive manipulated (e.g. how to resize or reparent stripes, use drag and drop for stripes, change stripe labels etc.). Also interaction with the layout engine is shown. |

## Running the Demos
