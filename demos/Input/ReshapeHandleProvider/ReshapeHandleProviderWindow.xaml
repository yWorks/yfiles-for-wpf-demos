                        This demo shows how to implement a custom <Run FontStyle="Italic" Text="IReshapeHandleProvider"/>.

                    <Paragraph>
                        This <Run FontStyle="Italic" Text="IReshapeHandleProvider"/> is provided for ports to reshape their
                        port visualization.
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource HtmlH2}">

                                Select a <Run FontWeight="Bold" Foreground="{StaticResource DemoGreen}">green</Run>
                                or <Run FontWeight="Bold" Foreground="{StaticResource DemoLightblue}">blue</Run> port 
                                and see its reshape handles at its corners. Also note that there
                                is a different handle at the center that was provided by the 
                                <Run FontStyle="Italic" Text="IHandleProvider"/> to change the port location.

                                Drag one of the reshape handles to change the size of the port visualization. Note that
                                the size can't be decreased below a specific minimum size.

                                Press and hold <Run FontWeight="Bold">Ctrl</Run> and see that further reshape handles
                                appear on the left, right, top and bottom side of selected ports. These handles reshape the
                                port either horizontally or vertically.
