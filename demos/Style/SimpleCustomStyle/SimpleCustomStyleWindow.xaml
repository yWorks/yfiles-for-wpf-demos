                    This demo shows how to create custom styles for nodes, edges, labels, ports, 
                    and edge arrows from scratch and how to use them.
                    </Paragraph>
                    <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource HtmlH2}">
                        Things to Try
                    </Paragraph>
                    <List>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>
                            Create new nodes in the canvas and inspect their styles in code.                            
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>
                                Create edges between nodes and inspect the custom style of the edge and the arrows in code.
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>
                                Click "Modify Selected Nodes" to change the color of the nodes instance and indirectly the color of the outgoing edges.
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>
                                Note that the labels look like nodes connected via an edge, however they are ordinary labels that reuse the edge style for drawing a node to label connection. Select and drag a label to move them to different locations.
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>Also note that the label style depends on the current zoom. Zooming closer to the label reveals an edit label button that, when clicked starts label text editing.
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>Selecting an edge changes its color and the traditional selection indicator is not rendered.
                            </Paragraph>
                        </ListItem>
                        <ListItem>
                            <Paragraph>Save the graph to GraphML and take a look at the GraphML - the styles are automatically serialized to Xaml and can be read back in just as easily.
                            </Paragraph>
