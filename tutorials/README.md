# yFiles WPF Tutorials Overview
The [yFiles WPF](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfileswpf) tutorials are extensive Visual Studio projects with **full C# source code** that present the functionality of the yFiles WPF diagramming library. All tutorials can be found in subdirectories of the current directory. All tutorial steps are self-contained, i.e., they consist of a single Visual Studio project. 


## Working with the samples
All demos can be accessed by opening the solution file (yFiles Demos.sln) in this folder. 




### Upgrade instructions
If you currently have an active yFiles WPF subscription and license, and want to try out new (or old) demos, you have to place your existing license file in the `lib/net40` folder where it will be picked up when building demos in this package. 
### Required SDKs
The demos and tutorials in this folder are targeted to .NET Framework 4.8. You can change the framework in the projectâ€™s properties or the csproj file itself. The minimum required framework version is .NET Framework 4.5. 

In contrast to the Visual Studio installer, JetBrains Rider may not install the required .NET SDK versions. To run the demos seamlessly in Rider, an installation of .NET Framework 4.8 may be needed. If this is not desired, the target framework in the demo projects needs to be adjusted to the available version. 


### Troubleshooting

#### To run this application, you must install .NET / Target framework not installed
The demos target a .NET Framework which is not installed on your development machine. 

Either install an SDK which supports the required .NET Framework or update the target framework to a version which is already installed on your machine. 


#### Security Warning when Opening a Demo or Tutorial Project in Visual Studio
Visual Studio might show a Security Warning when opening the demo or tutorial solution. This happens because the solution and project files were contained in a zip archive which was downloaded from the web. 

It is safe to open the projects, anyway. 


#### Untrusted Solution yFiles Demos in JetBrains Rider
In JetBrains Rider, each solution you open is untrusted by default. Therefore, you see this dialog which lets you choose to trust the solution or not. You can find more details [in the JetBrains Rider help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Creating_and_Opening_Projects_and_Solutions.html#trusted-and-untrusted-solutions) 

The yFiles WPF demo project files contain a custom build target that automatically unblocks the yFiles WPF assemblies. This either uses PowerShell or cmd to unblock the files, but poses no known security risk. 

Click the **Trust and Open** button to open the solution. 


### Running a Single Sample
To open a specific programming sample, the corresponding Visual Studio project file (usually named `[demoname].csproj`) can be found in the demo's directory, which also uses the `[demoname]` naming scheme. <br /> Note that samples that demonstrate related aspects are grouped together in solution folders.
