# 01 Getting Started
The yFiles WPF tutorial is a step-by-step introduction to the concepts and the features of the yFiles WPF diagramming library. It is intended for developers that want to get started with the library in an effective way. <br /> The tutorial shows you both basic concepts and also how to build a diagramming application that supports custom styles, full user interaction, Undo/Redo, clipboard, I/O, grouping and folding. 

If you are new to the yFiles WPF diagramming library, it is recommended to start by going through the projects in this tutorial one by one. To make full use of the tutorial, it is also recommended to review and possibly modify the source code for each sample project. 



You will find the following programming samples in this package: 


| Name | Description 
|:---|:---
