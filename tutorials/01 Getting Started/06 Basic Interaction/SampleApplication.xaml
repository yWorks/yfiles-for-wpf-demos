                                node center exists). You can either create an edge directly between these port, or later 
                                move the source or target to a different port (just select the edge and drag the edge's 
                                source or target handle). Note that custom port locations are not part of this tutorial 
                                step, but are introduced later.

                                are determined by the label model for this label and show up as empty rectangles when you 
                                start dragging the label. You can only move a label to one of these positions.
